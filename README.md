# Husky Clicker Premium 
## From Lesson 1_13

## About this version
This version does not use `CLOSURES` as it was supposed to.  It does meet the functionality of the rubric however.  The functionaly was created by created cat `OBJECTS` stored into an array.  I then simply modify the array of objects upon the clicks.
